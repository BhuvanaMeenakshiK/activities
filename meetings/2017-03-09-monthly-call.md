## Aim of the HackNight

We have a lot of contributors in India, but not all these volunteers are not contributing consistently due to a variety of reasons. 
Through this Hacknight, we would like to boost the technical knowledge of all the participants.

    Ask people who already have basic knowledge of A-Frame to join us for the hack night as the main focus would be to deal with the next level of expertise.

    We want to focus on particular goals through this HackNight (scroll down to see the details)


## How to join?

    You can join independently online - Directly get in touch with Ram

    Join a group of people (offline) from your area who are already organising the event in your area.


## Expected expenses:

    Food for the overnight event. 

    Really cool gifts for the contest winners (will be directly sent to the winners)


## Goals:

    Prepare a really good get started guide for beginners.

    WebVR India github site with all possible info.

    Standard teaching/ workshop curriculum or presentation for facilitators.

    A-Frame registry needs to be promoted, used and contributed to.

    Lots and lots of amazing VR experiences created by the audience !



## Questions

    Viral: Will we teach them first and then conduct the event?

    Nope. This event will be for ppl who already have the basic knowledge of Aframe. If not, this is the best time to learn stuff.

    Mukesh: Will this be an online or an offline event?

    It'll be both ways, but everyone will stay connected online.

    Shahbaz: What I understood from this, is that it's like a codebase hacknight where ppl need to solve some problems and meet the specific goals?

    Exactly.

    Viral: Can we decide the tasks for the attendees to do in the event.

    Yes, we will be finalising the tasks before the event itself. So say, each group can work on one particular thing
