#### Questions/ Queries/ Suggestions/ Feedback

Harsh Sharma (suggestion):- Documentation and Written sources are not very beginner friendly, can we have some video lectures about making beginners getting started with WebVR
 and specifically A-Frame development.
Pranjal (question) :- can we have website which would be source or reference for beginners for getting started with A-Frame and WebVR development ?
Ram (reply to pranjal) :- yes, that would be a good idea, but we need someone to take initiative about it (forwarded to Md. Shahbaz).
Shahbaz (taking forwarded call by Ram) :- i would be a bit busy, but this would be good idea to have implemented, would see what can we do about it.
